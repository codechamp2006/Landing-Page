* Note:- This is still in alpha version.
  Most of the features might not work.
  Don't try to play around with any feature else it might crash(worst it might hog your cpu).
  A median latency of 30ms might be required for loading the site.(Warning:: This might eat your whole months available data(for those who do have limited available network data))
  The live site may not load properly(probably due to high-quality images and videos).
* Update:- Working to fit some sort of cdn to serve the images faster.
* Update:- Integrated Imagekit.io CDN to server the images faster. Now its much faster
  However, the background video still needs some seconds to load properly. (Working to fit a video cdn)
* Update:- Large update, Created and styled and animated the Contact Us page
